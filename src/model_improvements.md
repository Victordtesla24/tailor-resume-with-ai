# AI Model Improvements

## Current Issues

### 1. Training Data Quality
- Limited number of examples (only 2)
- Truncated content in both prompts and completions
- Missing section-specific training data
- No metrics on effectiveness
- No validation of output quality

### 2. Model Prompting
- Generic prompts not optimized for resume sections
- Missing context about formatting requirements
- No guidance on metrics preservation
- Lack of industry-specific context

### 3. Output Quality
- Inconsistent formatting
- Loss of important metrics
- Generic content not well-tailored to job
- Poor section organization

## Required Improvements

### 1. Training Data Collection
- Implement proper data collection with complete content
- Add section-specific examples
- Include before/after examples with success metrics
- Track ATS scores for validation

### 2. Model Prompts
```python
SECTION_PROMPTS = {
    "summary": """
    Tailor this professional summary to highlight relevant experience for the job.
    Requirements:
    1. Preserve all quantitative metrics (%, $, numbers)
    2. Highlight key technical skills from job description
    3. Maintain professional tone and formatting
    4. Keep original structure while enhancing relevance
    
    Original Summary:
    {original_text}
    
    Job Description:
    {job_description}
    
    Focus on:
    - Technical expertise matching job requirements
    - Relevant achievements with metrics
    - Key methodologies and practices
    - Soft skills important for the role
    """,
    
    "experience": """
    Enhance these experience entries to align with the job requirements.
    Requirements:
    1. Preserve ALL metrics and achievements
    2. Highlight relevant technical skills
    3. Maintain chronological order
    4. Keep bullet point format
    
    Original Experience:
    {original_text}
    
    Job Description:
    {job_description}
    
    Focus on:
    - Achievements relevant to the role
    - Technical skills matching requirements
    - Leadership and soft skills
    - Quantifiable impacts
    """,
    
    "skills": """
    Organize and prioritize skills based on job requirements.
    Requirements:
    1. Group by category (Technical, Methodologies, Tools, Soft Skills)
    2. Prioritize skills mentioned in job description
    3. Maintain clear formatting with bullet points
    4. Keep relevant skills even if not mentioned in job
    
    Original Skills:
    {original_text}
    
    Job Description:
    {job_description}
    
    Focus on:
    - Technical skills matching requirements
    - Methodologies and practices
    - Tools and technologies
    - Relevant soft skills
    """,
    
    "education": """
    Highlight relevant education and coursework.
    Requirements:
    1. Keep all degrees and institutions
    2. Highlight relevant coursework
    3. Maintain chronological order
    4. Preserve dates and locations
    
    Original Education:
    {original_text}
    
    Job Description:
    {job_description}
    
    Focus on:
    - Relevant degrees and certifications
    - Coursework matching job requirements
    - Technical training and skills
    - Professional development
    """
}
```

### 3. Quality Validation
- Implement stricter validation rules
- Check for metrics preservation
- Validate formatting consistency
- Ensure section completeness

## Implementation Steps

1. Fix Training Data Collection
```python
def collect_training_data(
    resume_text: str,
    job_description: str,
    tailored_text: str,
    section: str,
    ats_score: float,
    metrics_preserved: bool,
    formatting_score: float
) -> None:
    """Collect comprehensive training data."""
    data = {
        "input": {
            "resume": resume_text,
            "job_description": job_description,
            "section": section
        },
        "output": {
            "tailored_text": tailored_text,
            "metrics": {
                "ats_score": ats_score,
                "metrics_preserved": metrics_preserved,
                "formatting_score": formatting_score
            }
        }
    }
    # Save to training data file
    with open("training_data.jsonl", "a") as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
        f.write("\n")
```

2. Enhance Model Selection
```python
def select_model(section: str, content_length: int) -> str:
    """Select appropriate model based on section and content."""
    if section == "summary":
        return "gpt-4"  # Best for high-level synthesis
    elif section == "experience":
        return "gpt-4"  # Good for detailed analysis
    elif section == "skills":
        return "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Efficient for list processing
    elif section == "education":
        return "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Simple formatting tasks
    else:
        return "gpt-4"  # Default to most capable model
```

3. Implement Quality Checks
```python
def validate_output(
    original: str,
    tailored: str,
    job_description: str,
    section: str
) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """Validate tailored output quality."""
    issues = []
    
    # Check metrics preservation
    original_metrics = extract_metrics(original)
    tailored_metrics = extract_metrics(tailored)
    if not all(m in tailored_metrics for m in original_metrics):
        issues.append("Lost important metrics")
    
    # Check keyword alignment
    job_keywords = extract_keywords(job_description)
    if not keywords_aligned(tailored, job_keywords):
        issues.append("Missing key job requirements")
    
    # Validate formatting
    if not validate_formatting(tailored, section):
        issues.append("Incorrect formatting")
    
    # Check completeness
    if len(tailored) < 0.8 * len(original):
        issues.append("Content too short")
    
    return len(issues) == 0, issues
```

## Next Steps
