Smart Resume Tailoring App: Implementation Guide
Personal Invocation
“Cursor AI, take a deep breath and become our Senior Developer—someone with 20+ years of coding across multiple paradigms. Your philosophies:
1.	Less code is better code.
2.	Aim for modern, appealing designs with minimal complexity.
3.	Solve errors swiftly and thoroughly.
Please keep code generation concise and focus on the essential parts that yield functionality and clarity. If extra fluff appears, prune it. Let’s build an efficient, modern, and user-friendly app.”
 
1. Setting the Stage
1.	Project Goal
o	A Smart Resume Tailoring App built on MacBook Air M3.
o	Developed with Python + Streamlit.
o	Uses multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
o	Guided by Cursor AI wearing its senior dev hat (i.e., minimal code, maximum clarity).
2.	Fail Fast, Iterate Quickly
o	Launch a basic MVP, test with real data, then refine.
o	If features fail or become unwieldy, drop or fix them immediately.
o	Maintain tight feedback loops for user experience improvements.
3.	Senior Dev Persona Principles
o	Keep It Simple: Provide only necessary imports and code.
o	Small, Elegant Functions: Each function has a clear single purpose.
o	Efficient Error Handling: Catch and explain errors briefly; don’t bury them under layers of logging.
 
2. Environment Setup (Minimalist Edition)
1.	Install Python (if needed):
2.	brew install python
3.	Create & Activate Virtual Environment:
4.	python3 -m venv resume_app_env
5.	source resume_app_env/bin/activate
6.	Install Requirements:
7.	pip install streamlit openai anthropic python-docx requests beautifulsoup4 selenium python-dotenv
8.	Acquire & Open Cursor AI
o	Download from cursor.sh.
o	Open project folder.
o	Confirm environment works by running a small test: 
o	print("Senior Dev Persona in effect, environment is ready!")
9.	Basic Security/Privacy Note
o	By default, we store data locally and do not share it with third parties unless the user opts in for data collection (see Iteration 2).
o	If handling user resumes for real production, consider GDPR/CCPA compliance and ensure you have a clear data retention policy.

Instructions to Cursor AI
“Cursor AI, you are in senior dev mode. Generate a lean app.py that accomplishes the following MVP requirements with minimal code and strong clarity.”
Proposed MVP Code:
import streamlit as st
import openai
from docx import Document

openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

st.title("Smart Resume Tailoring App")

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your resume (Word)", type=["docx"])
job_description = st.text_area("Paste Job Description")
sections = st.multiselect("Select sections", ["Summary", "Experience", "Skills", "Education"])

if st.button("Tailor Resume"):
    if uploaded_file and job_description and sections:
        # Basic docx extraction
        doc = Document(uploaded_file)
        resume_text = "\n".join(p.text for p in doc.paragraphs)

        prompt_text = (
            f"Here’s my resume:\n{resume_text}\n\n"
            f"Please tailor these sections: {', '.join(sections)} "
            f"for this job:\n{job_description}"
        )

        try:
            response = openai.Completion.create(
                engine="davinci",
                prompt=prompt_text,
                max_tokens=1000
            )
            st.text_area("Tailored Resume", response.choices[0].text)
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"AI Error: {str(e)}")
    else:
        st.warning("Please upload a resume, enter a job description, and select sections.")
Run:
streamlit run app.py
Performance Note
•	For small .docx files, this should be well under 3 seconds to parse.
•	The OpenAI API call typically responds within 5–8 seconds for max_tokens=1000.
 
4. Iteration 1: Multi-AI Model Selector & API Key Management

API Key Management
1.	Create a .env.example template: 
2.	OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
3.	ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-key-here
4.	DEEPMIND_API_KEY=your-key-here  # When available
5.	Add to .gitignore: 
6.	.env
7.	Load keys securely: 
8.	from dotenv import load_dotenv
9.	import os
10.	load_dotenv()
11.	
12.	def init_ai_client(provider: str):
13.	    """Initialize AI client with appropriate API key."""
14.	    if provider == "OpenAI":
15.	        api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY", "").strip()
16.	        if not api_key or not api_key.startswith("sk-"):
17.	            raise ValueError("Invalid OpenAI API key")
18.	        return openai
19.	    elif provider == "Anthropic":
20.	        import anthropic
21.	        api_key = os.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "").strip()
22.	        if not api_key or not api_key.startswith("sk-ant-"):
23.	            raise ValueError("Invalid Anthropic API key")
24.	        return anthropic.Client(api_key=api_key)
25.	    else:
26.	        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported provider: {provider}")
Model Selection Process
MODELS = {
    "OpenAI GPT-4": {
        "provider": "OpenAI",
        "id": "gpt-4",
        "description": "Best for general-purpose resume tailoring with strong reasoning",
        "max_tokens": 2000,
        "temperature": 0.7
    },
    "OpenAI GPT-3.5": {
        "provider": "OpenAI",
        "id": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
        "description": "Fast and cost-effective for straightforward tailoring",

        "max_tokens": 1500,
        "temperature": 0.6
    }
}

with st.sidebar:
    st.header("Choose AI Model")
    selected_model = st.selectbox(
        "Select Model",
        options=list(MODELS.keys()),
        help="Choose the AI model that best suits your needs"
    )
    config = MODELS[selected_model]
    st.markdown(f"### Model Profile\n{config['description']}")
Resume Tailoring Implementation
def tailor_resume(resume_text: str, job_description: str, sections: list, config: dict) -> str:
    """Tailor resume using selected AI model."""
    try:
        client = init_ai_client(config["provider"])
        prompt = f"Tailor these sections: {', '.join(sections)}\n\nResume:\n{resume_text}\n\nJob Description:\n{job_description}"

        if config["provider"] == "OpenAI":
            # For Chat Completions
            response = client.ChatCompletion.create(
                model=config["id"],
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
                max_tokens=config["max_tokens"],
                temperature=config["temperature"]
            )
            return response.choices[0].message["content"]

        elif config["provider"] == "Anthropic":
            response = client.completion(
                prompt=prompt,
                model=config["id"],
                max_tokens_to_sample=config["max_tokens"]
            )
            return response.completion

    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
Testing
•	Provide valid keys in .env.
•	Manual test: Switch from “OpenAI GPT-4” to “Anthropic Claude” in the sidebar. Attempt a resume tailoring and confirm no code changes needed.
•	Performance: Minimal difference in speed if you switch providers.
 
User Feedback:
“Thanks for the detail so far. That is helpful. Please continue with the next iterations and added code examples.”
 
5. Iteration 2: Data Collection for Fine-Tuning
Dependencies
•	Requires: Iteration 1 (API Key Management)
•	Next: Iteration 3 (Job Board Integration)
Success Criteria
1.	Data Collection
o	Secure data storage
o	Proper anonymization
o	User opt-in working
2.	Performance
o	No UI lag during collection
o	Minimal storage usage
o	Efficient data format (e.g., JSON Lines)
3.	Testing
o	Manual check: Tailor a sample resume, opt in to share data, and confirm the anonymized data is appended to a training_data.jsonl file without errors.
Implementation Checkpoints
•	Data storage mechanism working
•	Opt-in functionality complete
•	Anonymization implemented
•	Error handling in place
Why?
•	Over time, the app learns from real usage, improving suggestions.
•	Senior Dev Persona: minimal but robust data capture.
Implementation Sketch
import json
import streamlit as st

def collect_training_data(resume_text, job_description, tailored_output):
    """Store prompt+completion data for fine-tuning, if user opts in."""
    data = {
        "prompt": f"Resume: {resume_text[:300]}...\nJobDesc: {job_description[:300]}...",
        "completion": tailored_output[:300]  # store partial to limit data size
    }
    with open("training_data.jsonl", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps(data) + "\n")

share_data = st.checkbox("Opt-in to share anonymized data for AI improvement")

if st.button("Tailor Resume"):
    # Assume we've read doc paragraphs into resume_text
    tailored_output = tailor_resume(resume_text, job_description, sections, config)
    st.text_area("Tailored Resume", tailored_output, height=200)

    if share_data:
        try:
            collect_training_data(resume_text, job_description, tailored_output)
            st.success("Training data saved (anonymized).")
        except Exception as e:
            st.error(f"Could not save training data: {e}")
Performance Note: Saving small JSON lines is typically negligible in CPU/memory usage. The main cost is still the AI inference.
Privacy Consideration: We only store partial text ([:300]) to limit sensitive data. If more robust privacy is needed, consider advanced anonymization (e.g., removing names, addresses).
 
6. Iteration 3: Job Board Integration
Dependencies
•	Requires: Iteration 2 (Data Collection)
•	Next: Iteration 4 (Preserving Formatting)
Success Criteria
1.	Integration
o	Successful URL parsing
o	Accurate job description extraction
o	Proper error handling
2.	Performance
o	Response time < 5 seconds for typical job pages
o	Graceful failure handling
o	Clear user feedback
3.	Testing
o	Manual check: Provide a valid Seek.com.au job URL, verify the job description is extracted. Then tailor the resume using that fetched text.
Implementation Checkpoints
•	URL validation working
•	Job description extraction functional
•	Error handling implemented
•	User feedback system in place
Why?
•	Automate job description fetching from sites like seek.com.au.
•	If scraping fails, handle gracefully.
Implementation Sketch
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def fetch_job_from_seek(url):
    """Fetch job description from a Seek.com.au listing."""
    try:
        resp = requests.get(url)
        resp.raise_for_status()  # raise exception if status != 200
        soup = BeautifulSoup(resp.text, "html.parser")
        job_desc = soup.find("div", {"class": "jobAdBody"})
        if job_desc:
            return job_desc.get_text(separator="\n").strip()
        else:
            return "Couldn't parse job description from this page."
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error fetching job: {e}"

job_url = st.text_input("Seek.com.au Job URL (optional)")
if job_url:
    fetched_desc = fetch_job_from_seek(job_url)
    if fetched_desc.startswith("Error"):
        st.error(fetched_desc)
    else:
        st.text_area("Fetched Job Description", fetched_desc, height=200)

# Then pass fetched_desc into your tailoring prompt if desired
Performance Note: Simple GET requests plus parsing are typically under 1 second. If Seek’s structure changes, update or remove this feature swiftly (fail fast).
Testing Tip: Use known job URLs and invalid URLs to confirm error handling.
 
7. Iteration 4: Preserving Resume Formatting & Cosmetics
Dependencies
•	Requires: Iteration 3 (Job Board)
•	Next: Iteration 5 (Side-by-Side View)
Success Criteria
1.	Formatting
o	Style preservation accurate
o	Font matching working
o	Layout maintenance
2.	Output Quality
o	Clean document structure
o	Professional appearance
o	Consistent styling
3.	Testing
o	Manual check: Upload a resume with varied fonts (e.g., Calibri in the Summary, Arial in Experience). Tailor the Summary. Confirm the final .docx keeps each section’s style.
Implementation Checkpoints
•	Style extraction working
•	Format preservation functional
•	Document generation complete
•	Download option implemented
Why?
•	Users spend time perfecting the look of their resumes.
•	Senior Dev Persona: keep the solution minimal but effective.
Key Implementation Ideas
1.	Analyzing the Original Resume
o	Use python-docx to read paragraphs and runs, capturing font name, size, bold/italic, color.
2.	Merging AI-Modified Text
o	Identify sections replaced by the AI.
o	Insert new text into the doc while retaining style (or a close approximation).
3.	User Download Option
o	Provide a download button for the final .docx.
o	Optionally, convert to PDF using docx2pdf.
Code Snippet

    # For each updated section, find the relevant paragraph(s)
    for para_idx, new_text in updated_sections.items():
        doc.paragraphs[para_idx].clear()
        # Re-inject text with the old style
        # In a real scenario, you'd do more complex matching with style_map
        for line in new_text.split("\n"):
            run = doc.paragraphs[para_idx].add_run(line)
            # Re-apply style
            # For simplicity, let's just use the first run's style:
            first_run_style = style_map[para_idx]["runs"][0]
            run.bold = first_run_style["bold"]
            run.italic = first_run_style["italic"]
            if first_run_style["font_name"]:
                run.font.name = first_run_style["font_name"]
            if first_run_style["font_size"]:
                run.font.size = first_run_style["font_size"]

    doc.save("Updated_Resume.docx")
    return "Updated_Resume.docx"

if st.button("Update & Download Formatted Resume"):
    doc_path = "uploaded_resume.docx"  # assume we've saved it
    updated_paragraphs = {2: "AI generated summary..."}  # example mapping

    with open(final_path, "rb") as f:
        st.download_button("Download Tailored Resume", f, file_name="Tailored_Resume.docx")
Fail Fast: If advanced formats (tables/columns) break, disclaim or skip them.
 
8. Iteration 5: Original vs. Tailored Resume (Side-by-Side)
Dependencies
•	Requires: Iteration 4 (Formatting)
•	Next: Iteration 6 (Flexible Section Selection)
Success Criteria
1.	UI Performance
o	Smooth side-by-side display
o	Responsive comparison
o	Clear visual differentiation
2.	User Experience
o	Intuitive layout
o	Easy to spot changes
o	Minimal flicker or re-render issues
3.	Testing
o	Manual check: After tailoring, show “Original” in one column, “Tailored” in the other. Confirm the text is displayed properly.
Implementation Checkpoints
•	Two-column layout working
•	Content synchronization complete
•	Visual comparison clear
•	Performance optimization done
Why?
Users want a side-by-side view for quick “before vs. after” checks.
Implementation Snippet
def display_side_by_side(original_text, tailored_text):
    col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

    with col1:
        st.subheader("Original Resume")
        st.write(original_text)

    with col2:
        st.subheader("Tailored Resume")
        st.write(tailored_text)

# Usage in your main code:
st.write("Compare below:")
display_side_by_side(resume_text, tailored_output)
Performance Note: For large resumes, st.write() can be slightly slow. If you see issues, consider using st.text_area() with height adjustments.
 

9. Iteration 6: Flexible Section Selection ("Click & Choose")
Dependencies
•	Requires: Iteration 5 (Side-by-Side View)
•	Next: Iteration 7 (WOW Factor)
Success Criteria
1.	Selection Interface
o	Intuitive paragraph selection
o	Clear visual feedback
o	Efficient user interaction
2.	Processing
o	Accurate paragraph identification
o	Proper content preservation
o	Format retention (building on Iteration 4’s logic)
3.	Testing
o	Manual check: Upload a .docx resume with 5–6 paragraphs, let the user click checkboxes for certain paragraphs to tailor, then confirm only those selected paragraphs are changed.
Implementation Checkpoints
•	Paragraph parsing working
•	Selection UI functional
•	Content preservation verified
•	Format retention tested
Why?
Rather than forcing a user to choose from a fixed set of sections (e.g., “Summary,” “Experience”), allow them to pick exactly which paragraphs to tailor.
Features
1.	Paragraph Parsing
o	Use python-docx to enumerate paragraphs, storing each in a list or dict with an ID/index.
2.	AI Tailoring Only for Selected Paragraphs
o	Gather the text for only the user-selected paragraphs.
o	Generate new text with the AI.
o	Merge it back into the doc using the same approach from Iteration 4.
3.	Preserve Formatting & Merge
o	The replaced paragraphs keep the original style (font, size, bold, etc.).
o	Unselected paragraphs remain untouched.
Implementation Sketch

    """
    Return a list of (paragraph_index, text).
    This helps the user decide which paragraphs to tailor.
    """

        # Exclude empty paragraphs if desired
        if para.text.strip():
            paragraphs.append((idx, para.text.strip()))
    return paragraphs

uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload your resume (Word)", type=["docx"])
if uploaded_file:
    doc = Document(uploaded_file)
    all_paragraphs = parse_paragraphs(doc)

            all_paragraphs[i][1] for i in selected_indices
        )
        
        prompt = f"Please rewrite the following paragraphs more effectively:\n{to_tailor_text}"
        # E.g., call your tailor_resume function or direct API
        # Then re-insert using style logic from Iteration 4
Performance Note: For large resumes (20+ paragraphs), be mindful that listing them in a multiselect might get cluttered. If so, consider pagination or a more advanced UI approach.
Testing:
•	Manual: Check or uncheck certain paragraphs to confirm only those are modified.
•	Edge Cases: If a paragraph is empty or user selects none, ensure the code gracefully handles it.
 
10. Iteration 7: “WOW” Factor & Enhanced User Experience
Dependencies
•	Requires: Iteration 6 (Flexible Selection)
•	Next: (Optional Future Enhancements below)
Success Criteria
1.	User Interface
o	Modern, clean design
o	Responsive interactions
o	Intuitive controls (inline editing, if possible)
2.	Features
o	ATS scoring accurate
o	Real-time previews working
o	Inline editing functional (optional advanced feature)
3.	Performance
o	Quick response times (no lag if multiple paragraphs are edited)
o	Smooth transitions or animations
o	Efficient updates
4.	Testing
o	Manual check: Confirm that enabling “Optimize Resume” or an ATS scoring feature updates in real time, or with minimal friction for the user.
Why?
A visually impressive experience with real-time previews, inline editing, and advanced ATS hints can set this app apart. This is where you truly “wow” users.
Key Features
1.	Inline Editing / Suggesting Mode
o	One approach: highlight AI-suggested changes in color-coded text.
o	The user can accept or reject changes line by line.
o	Implementation: Possibly rely on a text diff library or a JavaScript-based “track changes” approach if Streamlit alone is insufficient.
2.	One-Click “Optimize Resume”
o	The user hits one button to let the AI pick relevant sections automatically, fetch job descriptions if needed, and produce a final “before vs. after” view.
o	Minimizes user steps—good for novices wanting a quick fix.
3.	ATS “Score” or “Readiness Indicator”
o	The app quickly scans for keywords from the job description, awarding a “% match.”
o	Potential expansions: grammar checks, brand voice alignment, or advanced skill matching.
4.	Visual Theme
o	Provide subtle accent colors or a “2025 standard template” for a forward-thinking design.
o	Offer a final “print-friendly” or “PDF view.”
Implementation Sketches
•	ATS Score:
•	def extract_keywords(job_description):
•	    # Basic tokenizer or advanced approach
•	    # Return list of relevant keywords
•	    return [kw.strip().lower() for kw in job_description.split() if len(kw) > 4]

•	score = ats_score_check(tailored_output, job_desc_text)
•	st.metric(label="ATS Match Score", value=f"{score}%")
•	One-Click Optimize:
•	if st.button("Optimize Resume"):
•	    # Possibly auto-detect relevant paragraphs
•	    # Tailor them with advanced prompts
•	    # Show final side-by-side
•	    ...
Performance Note: Simple keyword scanning is fast. For large text or advanced NLP, consider caching.
Testing:
•	Check “Optimize Resume” on a typical 2-page resume. It should respond in < 10 seconds total.
•	Verify ATS score updates if the user modifies text afterward.
 
11. Future Enhancements
1.	Industry-Specific Tailoring
o	Provide a config for finance vs. tech vs. healthcare, each with unique style guides and prompts.
2.	Advanced Prompt Library
o	Maintain specialized prompts for bullet formatting, quantitative achievements, “thought leadership,” etc.
3.	Multilingual Support
o	Auto-detect resume language; optionally tailor in a different language.
4.	LinkedIn Integration
o	Parse the user’s LinkedIn to keep both in sync with the newly tailored resume.
5.	Security & Privacy
o	If storing data on a server, ensure encryption at rest.
o	Provide a data retention policy or “Delete My Data” option.
 
12. Conclusion & Next Steps
1.	Iterative Growth
o	With the MVP done and Iterations 1–4 ensuring stable core features, you can incrementally add the advanced UI (Iterations 5–7).
o	Always test after each iteration to maintain a robust user experience.
2.	Adherence to Senior Dev Persona
o	Keep solutions minimal, fail fast if a feature proves cumbersome.
o	Document only where clarity is needed.
3.	Focus on the User
o	Does each new feature genuinely benefit the end-user and help them secure more interviews? If not, pivot or drop it.
4.	Gather Feedback
o	Real-world testers or your own user base can guide which advanced features (e.g., inline editing, ATS scoring) matter most.
o	Build from actual user pain points to ensure the “wow” factor aligns with real needs.
Happy Building
…and remember:
“Cursor AI, continue to embrace your 20+ years of coding experience: keep solutions minimal, elegant, and user-friendly, while delivering maximum impact!”
