Position: Solution Architect
Bank First was born by making a BOLD move. Now, we're on a mission to make more BOLD moves as we transform and grow.
We are proud to provide our community of educators and health-care workers with a bank that puts them first, because they put others first. We're committed to building a unique bank—one that’s different, sustainable, and centered around our Members.
Join us in breaking the mould and shaping the future of banking. We’re looking for innovative and creative minds ready to make a real impact.
So, what’s the role?
We’re seeking a dynamic Solution Architect for a 12-month period to support our transformation journey. You’ll play a critical role in designing and implementing innovative technology solutions to enable our bold ambitions.
In a typical week you will get involved with:
• Governing a range of project initiatives, ensuring alignment with strategic goals from requirement analysis to operational handover.
• Understand and own the documentation of the architecture current state.
• Lead and work with other experts to nail functional coverage, integration, hosting, data, and security.
• Partner with the Principal Architect to continuously improve the architecture practice at Bank First, driving best practice.
This is a 12-month fixed term opportunity, with the possibility of a permanent role down the track.
About you
You’re the kind of person that everyone goes to because you ask great questions to understand the needs and provide pragmatic solutions. You’re a big picture thinker and know when to dive into the detail. You thrive on solving complex problems and can understand business priorities.
You will come equipped with:
• A bachelor’s degree in computer science, information technology or related field.
• Proven experience as a Solution Architect (5 years of more) in a fast-paced environment preferably within financial services.
• Experienced in cloud transformation, SaaS adoption and defining and implementing solutions that meet business needs and timeframes.
• Domain expertise in multiple areas of architecture including application, information, integration, process, security and infrastructure.
Why join us?
• For-purpose, a bank committed to helping its Members and their community.
• Impactful work that will genuinely make a difference to the lives of our Members.
• Work with values-driven leaders, who actively develop talent and support you to grow your career. In an inclusive environment where you are empowered to Be Bold. Be Different. Be Sustainable. Be YOU!
• Work-life balance and flexibility, so you can work in a way that best suits you and supports your commitments outside of work. Family friendly parental leave, and paid superannuation up to 52 weeks.
• Hybrid working from our state-of-the-art offices to connect and collaborate, as well as focused time at home.
• Competitive remuneration with an additional one week ‘Be You’ leave, ‘Be Well’ wellbeing benefit, #BFF Club home loan offer, discounted insurance and free on-site parking.
