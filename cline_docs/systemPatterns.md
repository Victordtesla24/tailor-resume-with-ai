# System Architecture & Patterns

## Core Architecture

- Python-based application using Streamlit
- Modular design with separate components for:
  - Document handling
  - AI integration
  - ATS scoring
  - UI components

## Technical Decisions

- Streamlit for rapid UI development and modern components
- Python-docx for document parsing
- Multiple AI providers for enhanced tailoring
- Local file storage for data privacy
- Component-based architecture for maintainability

## Architecture Patterns

- Model-View separation
- Event-driven UI updates
- Stateless processing
- Modular component design
- Cache-based optimization

## Best Practices

- Minimal code complexity
- Clear function responsibilities
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Security-first approach
