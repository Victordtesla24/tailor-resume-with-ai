# Gap Analysis

## 1. MVP Gaps

### Core Functionality
Current:
- Basic file upload and text extraction
- Simple section selection
- Basic AI model integration
- Limited error handling

Required:
- Upload Word format (.docx) resumes only
- Extract text content successfully
- Generate tailored content for selected sections
- Display readable output
- File upload under 3 seconds
- AI response under 10 seconds
- Memory usage under 500MB

Recommendations:
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement memory tracking
3. Optimize file upload process
4. Improve content generation

### Error Handling
Current:
- Basic error catching
- Simple user feedback
- Limited recovery options

Required:
- Invalid file format detection
- API failure recovery
- Missing input validation

Recommendations:
1. Implement file format validation
2. Add API error recovery
3. Add input validation

### Multi-AI Model Integration
Current:
- OpenAI and Anthropic integration implemented
- Basic model switching
- Simple API key management

Required:
- All API keys load securely
- Model selection works
- Error handling for invalid keys
- No keys in code
- Proper environment validation
- Secure key storage
- Switching models quickly
- Minimal overhead in UI

Recommendations:
1. Enhance environment validation
2. Improve error handling
3. Add performance metrics
4. Implement model comparison

### Data Collection & Privacy
Current:
- Basic data anonymization
- Simple opt-in functionality
- Limited data storage format

Required:
- Secure data storage
- Proper anonymization
- User opt-in working
- No UI lag during collection
- Minimal storage usage
- Efficient data format

Recommendations:
1. Enhance data storage security
2. Improve anonymization
3. Optimize storage format
4. Add privacy settings

### Job Board Integration
Current:
- Seek.com.au integration implemented
- Structured data extraction
- Error handling in place
- Retry mechanism implemented

Required:
- Successful URL parsing
- Accurate job description extraction
- Proper error handling
- Response time < 5 seconds
- Graceful failure handling
- Clear user feedback

Recommendations:
1. Optimize response time
2. Improve error recovery
3. Enhance user feedback
4. Add more test cases

## Implementation Priority

1. Core MVP (Week 1)
   - File upload and validation
   - Text extraction
   - Section selection
   - Basic error handling

2. Performance (Week 2)
   - File upload optimization
   - AI response time
